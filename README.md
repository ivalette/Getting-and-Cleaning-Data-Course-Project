##Task to complete
You should create one R script called "run_analysis.R" that does the following. 
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Instructions before running the "run_analysis.R" script:
1) Create a local directory on your laptop called "Project".
2) Download the data from the link above to the "Project" folder
3) Unzip the data (if you do not have a Mac)
4) Copy the "run_analysis.R" scrip to the "Project" folder
5) Familiarize yourself with the datasets and the variables by reading the CookBook.md file
6) Run the "run_analysis.R" script in R or RStudio
