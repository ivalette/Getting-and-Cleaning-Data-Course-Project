========================================

Peer Assignment Project for the 3rd course of R Programming at Coursera

## Data to download
Here are the data for the project:

##Task to complete
You should create one R script called "run_analysis.R" that does the following. 
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Instructions before running the "run_analysis.R" script:
1) Create a local directory on your laptop called "Project".
2) Download the data from the link above to the "Project" folder
3) Unzip the data (if you do not have a Mac)
4) Copy the "run_analysis.R" scrip to the "Project" folder
5) Familiarize yourself with the datasets and the variables by reading the CookBook.md file
6) Run the "run_analysis.R" script in R or RStudio

##References
The second step of the assignment was done with the help of one of the best R programming book:"The Art of R Programming: A Tour of Statistical Software Design" by Norman Matloff (Kindle Edition). Help with the grep function is provided in Chapter 11 String Manipulation, Regular Expressions, location 5320 of 8657.
The last part of the exercice is also done with help from "The Art of R Programming: A Tour of Statistical Software Design" by Norman Matloff (Kindle Edition), Chapter 6 Factors and Tables, The Aggregate Function, location 2825 of 8657.
